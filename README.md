# calculator-js
Simple calculator application built using pure js, html, and css. The calculator will be able to perform basic functions such as add, subtract, multiply, and divide. The calculator only operates on two numbers at a time like a basic calculator found on the iPhone or on any default calculator application. 
# Plan
**Q:** What will be the interface?

**A:** The user will interact with the graphical user interface through a web browser built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Q:** What will the inputs be?

**A:** Numbers and simple math operators accessed through the front-end interface.

**Q:** What will the outputs be?

**A:** The evaluated outcome of the math expression inputted by the user displayed on the application output screen section.
